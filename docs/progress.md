# Progress

Headless rules engine, built milestone by milestone. Run all tests with `tools/run_tests.sh`
(refreshes the class cache, then runs GUT).

## Milestone 1: Data model - done

Built:
- `Affinity` (Type enum NEUTRAL, A-D + display names: the one place to rename colors).
- `CardEnums` (card types, keywords, triggers, targets, ops, durations, rarity).
- `CardData`, `EffectData` resources; `Deck`, `PlayerProfile` resources.
- Unified modifier types: `Modifier`, `ModifierSource`, `ModifierSet`.
- `CardBuilder` typed helper for defining cards/effects/modifiers in code and tests.
- Cards are saved as `.tres` (round trip verified). The 40-card content set is generated in
  milestone 8 into `data/cards/`.
- Enabled the `untyped_declaration` GDScript warning in `project.godot`.

Tests: 13 total (11 new).

Known issues: none.
