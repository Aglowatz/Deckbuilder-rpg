# Fable Nov 9 - report (in progress)

Brief: `docs/prompts/fable_nov9.md` (with the day pass `docs/prompts/day_nov9.md` as Part 0). Questions: `docs/overnight_inbox.md`,
"Fable Nov 9". Shots: `docs/overnight_shots/nov9c/`. Last night's report follows below under "Overnight Nov 9 - report".

## Part 1 - Batch 14 + Sable (23 images, all in the game)

Filed with `node tools/batch14_move.js --apply` (Pending Review/Batch 14 -> Approved_*; every replaced file to Drive `Superseded/` and a local copy in
`_art_source/superseded_batch14/`; Sable's old world sprites moved out of Approved_WorldTest). Importers run one Godot at a time: portraits, NPC sprites
(+ `sprite_normals.gd --only=SABLE --force`), card art, key art, bestiary, icons. Rows in `docs/art/batch14_nov9.csv` say "In game (Fable Nov 9)".

| Image | Replaces | Where it shows | Screenshot (`docs/overnight_shots/nov9c/`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| V-SABLE, V-SABLE_PLEASED, V-SABLE_SCHEMING | her three portraits (the redesign: fox, high jabot, no cleavage) | Sable's talks and shop | `b14_sable_talk.jpg` (real talk), `b14_v-sable_*_talkbox.jpg` (base, pleased, scheming) |
| SPR-SABLE-FRONT_IDLE / SIDE_IDLE / BACK_IDLE / FRONT_TALK (+ REF) | her four world sprites, `_n` normal maps regenerated | her stall in Crosspath | `b14_sable_stall_sprite.jpg` |
| V-TONIC_EXCITED, V-TONIC_OOPS | the human-woman variants (now the frog) | Tilly Tonic | `b14_tonic_talk.jpg`, `b14_v-tonic_excited_talkbox.jpg`, `b14_v-tonic_oops_talkbox.jpg` |
| NPC-GATEKEEPER_HAPPY, NPC-GATEKEEPER_STERN | the bearded-human variants (now the bear) | Brannoch | `b14_brannoch_talk.jpg`, `b14_npc-gatekeeper_happy_talkbox.jpg`, `..._stern_talkbox.jpg` |
| V-FENWICK_EXCITED | the human variant (now the magpie) | Fenwick | `b14_fenwick_talk.jpg`, `b14_v-fenwick_excited_talkbox.jpg` |
| V-THREADWELL_DELIGHTED | the human variant (now the mouse) | Pip | `b14_pip_talk.jpg`, `b14_v-threadwell_delighted_talkbox.jpg` |
| RES-IRON, BAS-G, B-13 | the glossy 3D plate, the cobalt vector Feastforge, the B-26 twin | hand and full size | `b14_hand.jpg` (all three in hand), `b14_cards_full.jpg` |
| STORY-PRIMM-P1, STORY-PRIMM-P2, STORY-REVEAL-KITCHEN | the giant-scale stills | the castle's phase cutscenes, the Test Kitchen reveal | `b14_primm_p1.jpg`, `b14_primm_p2.jpg`, `b14_reveal_kitchen.jpg` (real cutscene screen) |
| BST-ANTECHAMBER-SENTRY | the Windows-logo visor | the Collection Book's Bestiary, the Lab fight | `b14_bestiary_sentry.jpg` |
| ICON-ITEM-FIELDBANDAGE | the red-cross icon (now a leaf) | Tilly Tonic's shelf, the bag | `b14_item_vendor.jpg` |

- **The Pip pick:** `V-THREADWELL_DELIGHTED` (the first try). Against the base V-THREADWELL it keeps the hat's angle and bands, the patchwork coat
  with the same diamond patches and shoulder strap, the ears and the red neck ribbon. The `-ALT` has a steeper hat, much bigger ears and a pink
  sash; it is in Drive `Superseded/` (and `_art_inbox/batch14/`).
- **Held expressions:** `Portraits.HELD_EXPRESSIONS` is empty now (all five sets repainted on-species); the mood portraits show again. The release-basics
  test asserts the eight variants are offered and that Sable's pleased face is its own picture.
- **Other Sable images in the game:** searched every asset, data file and art sheet for her. Found only her three portraits, her four world sprites
  (both replaced) and her shop background `VS-SABLE` (the velvet salon: cards, curtains and shelves, **no figure** - nothing to redo). No card, still,
  loading painting or title art shows her. Nothing added to the art list for Sable.
- **The Red Cross emblem:** still on NPC-HESPER's cap and armband and on Hesper in STORY-EPI-WRINKLES. Fixed in code: `core/data/art_patches.gd`
  recolours red-dominant pixels inside two small normalised boxes per picture to a muted leaf green as the picture loads (Portraits and KeyArt call it;
  test `tests/core/data/test_art_patches.gd`). Seen in `b14_npc-hesper_talkbox.jpg` and `b14_epi_wrinkles_green_cross.jpg`. Two **REDO** rows added to
  `docs/art/art_audit_nov9.csv` (a leaf or heart instead of the cross). The new bandage icon has no cross.
- **Size and memory** (`docs/build_size_policy.md`): the 23 replaced files total 4.28 -> 4.66 MB in the repo (**+0.38 MB**; the portraits and cards are a
  little richer, the sentry doubled at 60 -> 91 KB, two stills shrank). Same count and import rules as before, so the pack moves by well under 1 MB
  against the 750 MB budget (the export in Part 2 gives the exact number). Memory: the same textures at the same sizes; the two patched pictures are
  rebuilt as ImageTextures once when loaded (the same VRAM as before; the CPU-side copy is transient) and sit in the bounded ArtCache like the rest.
- **Tools:** `tools/batch14_move.js`; `tools/story_still_shots.sh --ids=A,B`; `tools/shot.sh res://scenes/town.tscn x --open=bestiary:<Name_with_underscores>`;
  the card gallery's `--ids` now finds resources and infrastructure; the battle `--hand=` flag loads tokens (RES-*) too.
- **Gotchas met:** the portrait importer re-added the opaque NPC-PLAYER (reverted, as before); the NPC sprite importer rewrote the whole manifest
  (spliced only SABLE's entry: canvas 320x504 -> 304x512, `cloak_hue`/`head` kept); the importers' status writer dropped the "UI art kit" and
  "Dungeon maps" sections of `docs/art/art_status.md` (restored from HEAD); `core/zone/zone_defs.gd:46` references Session, which prints a compile
  error in every headless `-s` importer run (harmless: the import still completes).

## Part 2 - RC1 build and the real-build check

**Export:** `EXPORT_LOW_MEMORY_OK=1 bash tools/export_windows.sh 1.0.0-rc1` (1.4 GB free RAM; the export's own guard wants 2 GB, its hard stop is
1.2 GB; peak Godot working set 1.3 GB, 14 MB free at the worst moment, every check passed). **Zip:** `builds/TheWaywardPath-v1.0.0-rc1-windows.zip`
= **736 MB** (pack 847 MB, 14,101 files, 89 baked shaders, every MD5 and CRC checked; build folder 952 MB). The pack is over the 750 MB budget
warning because the music is at Vorbis q6 by the designer's decision (`docs/build_size_policy.md` has the new row). Release smoke on the
exported pack: **PASSED, 17/17** (title + version, New Game to the starting area, F8 report + screenshot + log copy, pause menu, no Dev Menu,
save to slot 2 and load back).

**Exported-build test, two layers** (shots `docs/overnight_shots/nov9c/rc1_pack_*.jpg` and `rc1_exe_*.jpg`):

| Check | On the real `.exe` (fresh user folder, real clicks and keys: `tools/exe_drive.ps1`) | On the exported pack (stock binary + test pack, play driver: `tools/play_exported.sh`) |
|---|---|---|
| First launch, no settings or save | ok: title with New Game / Settings / Credits / Quit, v1.0.0-rc1; the Low-end preset picked itself on this iGPU (log: "first launch: Low-end preset") | - |
| New game through the intro to Crosspath | ok: slot chooser, the wake-up still, the forest, the Rescuer, the Path choice (Beefcake), the forest free; Crosspath reached via the driver's jump in the pack run | ok (`x04`-`x05`) |
| Save, quit, reload | ok: autosave after the Path choice; a manual save to slot 1 ("Saved to Slot 1"); Quit Game; Continue on the next launch landed in the forest; Load Game lists the autosave and Slot 1 | - |
| A battle, a shop, the Deck Station, the Wardrobe, the Card Packs page, a minigame | - | ok: Quota's duel played by the pilot then won (`x10`-`x12`), Sable's stall (`x06`), Deck Station (`x07`), Wardrobe (`x08`), Card Packs (`x09`), the Gainlands quiz (`y07`-`y08`) |
| Settings that survive a restart | ok: Reduce motion ticked on launch 2, still ticked on launch 3 (`settings.cfg`: `reduce_motion=true`) | ok: run B seeded with run A's settings shows the tick (`y01`) |
| Low-end mode | ok: auto on first start (quality Low, 30 fps cap, render scale 0.5) | ok: forced quality 0 - town, the Gainlands, a battle (`z01`-`z03`) |
| The log file and Copy log | ok: `%APPDATA%\Deckbuilder-RPG\logs\wayward.log` (+ `.1`, `.2`), boot lines with OS/GPU/driver | ok: "Copied" toast (`x15`) |
| Credits and the AI disclosure | ok: "A game by Alex Glowatz", the licences, the AI section (launch 3) | ok (`x02`) |
| The hidden donation button | ok: no Support button on the title or the Credits head | ok |

**Differences from the editor found and fixed:** none in the game itself. Two things the real exe showed that the editor runs hid:
1. **Keyboard only at the title: Enter did nothing** (no button holds the focus until a pad or the mouse gives it). Fixed: the first keyboard
   Enter or arrow focuses the top menu button (`TitleScreen.keyboard_focus_menu`, test in `tests/test_title_art.gd`). Not re-exported for this
   (an rc1b export is not needed for a focus fix; it is in the next build).
2. The exported build's Escape is matched by physical key: a synthetic Escape without a scan code is ignored (a tooling fact, not a player issue).

**Tools made for this:** `tools/exe_drive.ps1` (drives the exported exe: `wait`, `key`, `press` with scan codes, `hold`, `click`, `shot`; never
touches the player's files - move `%APPDATA%\Deckbuilder-RPG` aside by hand), `tools/play_exported.sh` + a `play` mode and settings seeding in
`tools/run_exported_suite.sh`, the scripts `docs/review/play_scripts/exported_rc1_{a,b,c}.txt` and `exe_{a,b,c,d}.txt`.

**Fresh-eyes critic of the exported build:** see "Part 2.3" below (filled when the critic finished).

**RC1 notes:** `docs/release/rc1_notes.md` (what is in it, known issues, how to report). **The zip:** `C:\Dev\Deckbuilder-rpguilds\TheWaywardPath-v1.0.0-rc1-windows.zip`
(no Drive `Releases` folder exists; `docs/release/itch_upload.md` names the file).

## Part 0 - the day pass

| Item | Done | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Credits: Alex Glowatz as creator | yes | `data/credits/credits.cfg`; "A game by Alex Glowatz" + "Game design, direction and production: Alex Glowatz" on the Credits page (`01_credits_creator.jpg`), and under the title card in the end credits. Donation link empty: Support stays hidden. |
| Colour-blind symbols on, Dex stays | yes | both already in the game; inbox items 1 and 3 closed |
| Level hints at the walls | yes | every dungeon door (zone side and main dungeons, Swolympus, the Vault hatch, the Lab hatch, the castle, the Gallery, the Paste Works) says "Travellers here are usually around level N" under its prompt, **amber when 2+ levels under** (`02_hall_prompt_level9_amber.jpg` vs `03_..._level12_muted.jpg`); the full map's "Where to?" list says "(Dungeon entrance, usually level 11)" and the dungeon icon has the same line as a tooltip (`06_map_where_to.jpg`). `core/sim/level_hints.gd` reads `ProgressionModel.LEVELS`; test `tests/core/sim/test_level_hints.gd` (every dungeon but the level-1 cave has one). Balance unchanged. |
| Dark battle backdrop | dev-only, fixed | the UI sweep's shot 16 was `dev encounter quota`: its sim group "capital:lieutenant" is not a battle-context key, so the board fell back to the placeholder slate. The real Quota duel always had the Transit Yards board. The sim group is mapped now (`data/battleboards.json`), `07_dev_quota_board.jpg`. |
| itch upload guide | yes | `docs/release/itch_upload.md` (page, "$0 or donate", text, AI disclosure field, zip, screenshots, Draft/Restricted, Support link, playtesters, public flip, butler). |

# Overnight Nov 9 - report

Brief: `docs/prompts/overnight_nov9.md`. Tag `pre-overnight-nov9` marks the start. Questions: `docs/overnight_inbox.md`, "Overnight Nov 9".
**No export.** Last night's report is archived at `docs/overnight/nov8b/overnight_report_nov8.md`. Run on Opus 5.5 (not Fable); Claude
Code's low-memory reaper was *on* for this session, so every long Godot job was started detached and watched from the foreground.

## 1. The four real-fight playthroughs

Every Path played from a new save to the credits and through the postgame (the Lab, the Shattered Gallery, Swolympus, Loose Ends) with
**every fight real**: every node of every dungeon (the tutorial cave, all side dungeons, all four main dungeons, the castle, the postgame),
every gatekeeper, every boss phase. No decreed or auto wins - except after a **wall** (4 losses on the same dungeon), which is logged, then
decreed so the run can go on. Save and load at each zone change (state digest checked), plus one mid-dungeon save/load. A loss plays out
as a loss: the hero wakes at the respawn point, the dungeon starts over, and the bot walks back in.

| Path | Completed | Steps | Game time (bot) | Fights won / lost | Walls | Gold earned (target 21.3k) | Final level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Beefcake | **yes** | 119 / 119 | 1.08 h | 93 / 30 | 6 | 15,750 (74 %) | 24 |
| Necrocrat | **yes** | 119 / 119 | 1.03 h | 82 / 20 | 4 | 17,035 (80 %) | 23 |
| Gourmand | **yes** | 119 / 119 | 0.95 h | 82 / 16 | 3 | 16,510 (77 %) | 23 |
| Refusemancer | **yes** | 119 / 119 | 1.19 h | 100 / 15 | 2 | 19,155 (90 %) | 26 |

**How to read it.** The player is the game's own planning AI (ELITE, the same player as the balance sims) sitting in the hero's seat on the
real battle screen at battle speed x4 - so "game time" is bot time, several times shorter than a human's. Between fights it opens every
pack, wears its best gear, buys the best cards Sable has for its Paths (keeping a third of the purse), and rebuilds its deck with the Deck
Station's own "Suggest a deck" (two Paths once the game allows). It plays **no optional content**: no roamers, arena bouts, quiz, Dex or
favours beyond the one each zone needs (those are set by flag) - so it arrives everywhere **3-5 levels under** `ProgressionModel`'s
expected player, and its gold is short of the 21.3k no-grind target for the same reason (the target counts the optional fights).

**Losses by encounter** (level at the time): full lists in `docs/playthroughs/full_real_<path>_nov9.log` ("FULL loss" lines).
- **Primm (all four Paths, a wall in all four):** levels 16-20. Expected player: 21.
- **The Shattered Gallery (all four, a wall in all four):** levels 22-25. Expected: 26.
- **The fourth zone's main dungeon** (the Rotheart for Beefcake and Gourmand, a wall for both): levels 14-15. Expected: 17.
- **The second zone's main dungeon** (the Hall of Final Approvals for Beefcake, the House of Gains for Necrocrat; both walls): level 9. Expected: 11.
- **S-NECRO, the D.N.A. side dungeon** (a wall for Beefcake and Necrocrat): levels 5-9. Expected: 10. It opens with the D.N.A. favour,
  so a player who takes it as soon as it opens meets it about 4 levels early.
- Lighter: the Lab (L19-21, one wall), Swolympus (L23-25), the House of Gains boss for its own Path (L5, beaten on the 2nd-3rd try).

**Difficulty walls a normal deck can't pass:** none that stay walls once the hero is at the expected level - every wall above sits 2-5
levels under it. But a **story-only player will stall at Primm and at the Gallery** on every Path, and at the second and fourth main
dungeons on some. Recommendation (owner's call, not changed tonight): say it in the game - e.g. Maren or the dungeon entrance noting
"most travellers are level N before this" - or soften those four by one step. The balance sims are the tool to pick which.

**Dev help used:** walking (teleports to spots, the zone road walk, the Lab hatch, the Rift Express, Swolympus travel), favour steps and
Maren's early chain set by flag, Old Man Mountain's errand by its counter, and the decree after each wall. Nothing else.

## 2. Blockers found and fixed

| # | Found | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Primm's Castle could strand the player** (ship blocker). Its side branches nest (courtyard -> Grand Foyer -> Portrait Gallery -> two wings); after the wings the map sent the party back one level only, onto the Gallery, with nothing left open. Nothing to click; only Retreat (which resets the final dungeon). The Beefcake run hit it 18 times (the bot jumped ahead, logged). | **fixed**: `DungeonMap.complete` keeps doubling back the way the party came until a node has an open path. New test walks every dungeon as a completionist and with 20 random walkers each (fails on the old code, passes now). The three later runs met it 0 times. |
| 2 | **Rewards screen: a second Take/Skip press** (double click, or E right after a click) applied the rewards again, stacked a second level-up panel and ran the after-rewards step twice (the tutorial's completion twice). | **fixed**: one confirm per screen. |
| 3 | **Dungeon map: choosing a node while its cutscene played** started it again on top (stacked cutscenes). | **fixed**: picks are ignored while a node cutscene is up. |
| 4 | **The Credits page showed its own editing notes** as its first heading. | **fixed** (+ test). |
| - | **Still open:** none found that blocks finishing the game. Watch item: the walls in section 1. | - |

## 3. Game feel and polish (Part 2)

Most of the battle-impact list was already in the game (Battle feel, Oct 28-29: card lift and land with dust, wind-up lunge, hit-stop,
shake scaled to damage, floating damage numbers, the dissolve shader, buff numbers). Tonight filled what was missing and checked the rest.

**Battle impact (new tonight)**
- **Reduce motion** (Settings > Accessibility, saved): no screen shake, no hit-stop, no final-blow slow motion; lunges, recoils, pops and the
  turn-banner sweep at 30 %; half the particles. A superset of "Reduce screen shake".
- **Buffs** pop: the unit grows and settles with a green glow ring (the +x/+y number was already there).
- **Healing**: a green glow ring on the healed portrait, under the burst and the "+N HP".
- **Unit death**: the burst is now in the unit's Path colour (it was a fixed peach), matching the dissolve edge.
- **Turn banner**: 0.62 s instead of 0.75 s (both sides).
- Before/after: `docs/overnight_shots/nov9b/` (Dex, UI sweep); battle feel is motion, so it is described rather than shot.

**Sound coverage:** `docs/audio/sound_coverage_nov9.md` lists every common action. Gaps filled:
1. the world purse: gold rising now chinks softly (at most every 0.5 s) and the HUD number pops;
2. Settings, Glossary, Feats, Credits and the save slots: open with a page sound, close with a soft back sound (they closed silently);
3. opening a town or zone screen no longer plays the close sound first (it "closed" nothing);
4. a miss at Dex's table has a sound.
Loudness re-measured with both tools: nothing sits more than 3 dB over its role; no change needed. Ducking verified in code: music -4.5 dB
under any dialogue box, -9 dB (story -13) under stings, eased. Default mix unchanged (music about 2 dB under effects).

**Transitions:** every scene change already goes through SceneManager's fade (no direct scene switches anywhere in the code). New: the full
loading screen only shows when it is needed - a destination that loaded in under 0.9 s earlier this session gets the plain fade (the
"still loading" card still appears if a load runs long). First visits keep the loading screen.

**UI consistency sweep:** 23 screens shot before and after (`docs/overnight_shots/nov9b/ui_before/` and `ui_after/`, script `docs/review/play_scripts/ui_sweep_nov9.txt`).
The frames, headers, buttons and focus rings already match the Deck Station across title, Settings, Character, Deck Station, Packs, Quest
Log, Map, Wardrobe, Pause, zone HUD, dungeon map and Dex. Strays found and fixed:
1. **the Credits page printed its own editing notes** ("The Credits screen's text... '#' lines are headings...") as its first heading - the
   file's header used heading marks; now comments, with a test;
2. the D.N.A. Rec Room memory cards could not take keyboard/pad focus (Dex's table could): now focusable with the shared focus ring.

## 4. Dex's Cardsharp's Circuit (Part 3): **finished - keep it in 1.0**

- **Played through end to end** by a new smoke (`tools/dex_circuit_smoke.tscn`): Dex's talk spot in all four zones (lines, quest offer,
  table), each table won, the final table opening after four, the turn-in, and the Matching Pair granted and worn: **46 / 46 steps**.
- **Scoring was unfair:** "12 moves or fewer" (11 at the final) out of 14. Simulated: a *perfect* memory beat that only 55 % / 9 % of the
  time. Now 15 / 14 out of 20 - a careful player wins a zone table 82-97 % and the final 61-87 % (`docs/minigames/dex_odds_nov9.md`).
- **Rules:** one line under the score: "Flip two cards: that is one move. Find all eight pairs in 15 moves or fewer to beat Dex (the table
  allows 20)."
- **Polish to the Deck Station bar:** a green felt table with a gold rim, the Path's own card backs (the final table: the neutral back)
  instead of a "?", Dex's portrait at the head of the table with his name and a line after every move (pair, miss, win, close, out of moves;
  in `dungeon_content.json`, `cardsharp.quip.*`), "A pair! 3 of 8 found", and a miss that says to remember where the cards were.
- The prize's effect (draw a copy of your first spell each turn) was already tested.
- Shots: `docs/overnight_shots/nov9b/dex_*`.

## 5. Release basics (Part 4)

- **Autosave indicator:** a small quill turning in a gold ring with "Saving..." in the bottom-right corner on every autosave (it holds 0.9 s
  after the last save, then fades; slower under Reduce motion). `ui/widgets/save_indicator.gd`, `EventBus.game_saved`.
- **Colour-blind Path symbols ON by default** (`Settings.DEFAULT_COLORBLIND_SYMBOLS`; inbox item 1 says how to flip it).
- **Version 1.0.0-rc1**: title screen, log header, Credits page (all read `config/version`), Windows file/product version 1.0.0.0.
- **itch screenshots:** left as last night's - this screen cannot open a true 1920x1080 window (max about 1886x1061).
- **credits.cfg:** creator and donation link left empty, with `>>> OWNER` comments showing exactly where they go.

## 6. Final read of the main story (Part 5)

All 1,484 main-quest lines read in game order (prologue, Crosspath, the four gatekeepers, dungeons and freed-zone talks, Maren's four
memories, the cave-mouth scenes, the Capital's main beats, the castle, Primm, the ending and the post-ending scenes). The Nov 5 rewrite holds
up: voices match `docs/dialogue/story_voice_nov5.md`, clipped "short statements" are gone from the main line, and the jokes sit on side
characters. Fixed: 11 hand edits and 88 quote repairs (revertible: `node tools/apply_dialogue_pass.js --csv=docs/dialogue/edit_nov9.csv --revert`; the filled sheet is
`docs/dialogue/edit_nov9/story_read_applied.csv`):
- **69 lines of speech split across boxes** (a quote opened in one box and closed two boxes later: Agnes in the queue, Mortimer, Vellum,
  the notary, the whistleblower, Old Man Mountain, the throwers...) - every box now opens and closes its own quotes; plus 19 of Primm's
  lab notes and journals split the same way with single quotes.
- **Continuity:** Primm "in his pressed grey coat" after the fight (he wears white and gold); Primm "removed two people so that eleven
  thousand could be safe" (eleven thousand is the number he *corrected*) - now "a whole kingdom".
- **Repetition:** the blueprint vault and the early journals both used "They are good. They are so good." (Flex's repeated "it was not the
  part that matters" is a deliberate beat the Wanderer throws back at Primm - a story test caught my edit, so it stays.)
- **Clunky lines:** Clench's boss intro told you to get "off the wheel" inside his gym;
  Compostella's muddled "don't shut it away in a jar... Death is not the end of them".
- Kept on purpose: the Rescuer's "Tell me: which Path resonates within you?" is pinned word for word by a test (an earlier owner call).
- Fig Sly's black-market lines are locked by the tool and were not touched.
- Nothing contradicts the current quest steps, names or tutorials. Re-exported: `docs/dialogue/edit_nov9.csv` (4,357 rows, story order).

## 7. Plan for Nov 9-11 (updated)

- **Nov 9, day (owner):** answer the inbox (colour-blind default, Dex kept, the walls). Fill `data/credits/credits.cfg` (name, donation
  link). Generate Batch 14 (`docs/art/batch14_nov9.csv`, the five mood-variant sets first). Play Dex's table once - it should now feel winnable.
- **Nov 9, day (Claude):** import Batch 14 and un-hold the portrait variants. Decide the four walls with the balance sims (Primm, the
  Gallery, the 2nd/4th main dungeons, S-NECRO's opening point) or add "travellers are usually level N" hints - whichever you choose.
- **Nov 9, night run:** the S items left from the cut-or-finish list (quiz feedback, packs shelf scroll, Alembic bars, Wardrobe tint, Gallery
  tooltip), the forest light and the tutorial-cave restart; re-run one Path with `bash tools/run_full_real.sh <path>` after any balance change.
- **Nov 10, day:** play the first hour yourself on a clean save; one fresh-eyes critic (first hour).
- **Nov 10, night run:** Crosspath roof fade, the battle infrastructure row and hand cap, the full suite, an exported-build smoke.
- **Nov 11, day:** set `config/version` to 1.0.0 (the presets already say 1.0.0), export, test the zip on a second PC, set up the itch page
  from `docs/release/itch_page/`, upload, finalise `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

## Tests

Full suite in memory-safe shards (`bash tools/run_tests.sh --only=tests --size=12`): **2,878 / 2,882** on the full pass; the 2 failures
were tonight's (the version-preset test now compares the numeric part of "1.0.0-rc1"; the word-for-word Path question was restored) and
pass on re-run; 2 risky (pre-existing tests with no assertion). New tests: `tests/core/dungeon/test_map_never_strands.gd`, the Credits
notes test. New tools: `tools/run_full_real.sh <path>` (with a memory watchdog), `tools/story_playthrough.gd --full=1`,
`tools/dex_circuit_smoke.tscn`.
